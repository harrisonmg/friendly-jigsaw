# TODO
- server loads a new game
- serialize puzzle and send over websocket on connection
- client connects ot websocket and loads puzzle

# architecture
- server
    - tokio, warp
    - HTTPS REST API
        - auth server admin
        - load new image, cut and start puzzle
        - load a game state
        - download and save a game state
        - list and kick clients
    - serves wasm client
    - communicate with clients via websockets
        - new connection
            - server sends game state
        - accept actions
            - pickup
            - move
            - place
            - cursor location
        - broadcast updates to other clients
            - piece positions
            - piece placements
            - cursor locations and color
                - color randomly assigned by server on connection
        - automatically place piece or group on disconnect
    - game logic that occurs server side
        - piece connections checked by server and client on piece place
        - this should work since connections should be deterministic
        - placement only occurs when the server says so, requiring a round trip when the client drops a piece

- client
    - bevy, tungstenite, wasm
    - connect to server
    - download state
    - given a state, render the game
    - resiable reference image panel
    - shader for piece outline
    - display a little controls help box
    - accept player input
    - rollback-like state
        - render based on state + player input
        - apply updates from server regardless of player input
